            <p>Lina Filipovich is a multidisciplinary artist and musician, born in Minsk, Belarus, and based in Paris. Her practice spans electronic music, textile, installation, screen printing, and found footage film. Her work explores the deconstruction of religious iconography through a feminist and post-religious lens.</p>

            <p>Drawing from icons and biblical narratives, Lina seeks to liberate these symbols from their patriarchal context and reframe them within a feminist mythology. Using textile techniques and recycled fabrics, she fragments sacred codes and reconfigures them into new mythological forms.</p>

            <p>A graduate of the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d‚ÄôArts de Paris-Cergy, Lina is a member of the Paris-based artist collective Non √âtoile.</p>

            <p>Her installations and performances have been presented in venues such as the Centre Wallonie-Bruxelles and IRCAM/Centre Pompidou in Paris, Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin, Le Bon Accueil in Rennes, Le 6B in Saint-Denis, and Tour Orion in Montreuil.</p>

            <p>Her music, merging experimental electronics with deconstructed liturgical and classical compositions, has been released on international labels such as Time Released Sound (US), Umor Rex (Mexico), Blank Mind (UK), Central Processing Unit (UK), and Hundebiss (Italy).</p>

            <p>Her work has been featured in publications including DJ Mag, Electronic Sound Magazine, The Vinyl Factory, and Bandcamp Daily.</p>
